# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Project_centroid repository according to the specified requirements. The refactoring maintains all original functionality while significantly improving code organization, maintainability, and readability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Modularization
- **Extracted JavaScript**: Moved all inline JavaScript from HTML files into separate modules:
  - `js/utils.js` - Common utility functions and DOM helpers
  - `js/shapes.js` - Canvas drawing functions for geometric shapes
  - `js/centroid.js` - Core centroid calculation algorithms
  - `js/inertia.js` - Moment of inertia computation methods
  - `js/ui.js` - User interface interactions and form handling
  - `js/app.js` - Application initialization and configuration

- **Centralized CSS**: Created `css/styles.css` with all styling rules, including:
  - Responsive design patterns
  - Consistent form styling
  - Modern visual improvements
  - Mobile-friendly layout adjustments

### 2. HTML Structure Improvements
- **Clean HTML**: Removed all inline styles and scripts
- **Semantic Structure**: Added proper semantic HTML elements and classes
- **Accessibility**: Improved with proper alt text and form labels
- **Consistent Naming**: Used descriptive IDs and classes throughout

### 3. Duplicate Code Elimination
- **Consolidated Functions**: Merged similar shape creation functions
- **Unified Form Handling**: Created reusable form processing functions
- **Shared Utilities**: Extracted common calculations and DOM manipulations
- **Common Patterns**: Standardized event handling and validation

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- **JSDoc Comments**: Added comprehensive documentation for all functions
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust input validation and error management
- **Consistent Formatting**: Applied uniform indentation (2 spaces) and style
- **Meaningful Names**: Renamed variables and functions for clarity

### 5. File Structure
